## üöÄ About This Repository

This repository is based on the official [MDN HTML Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) but simplified and structured according to my own learning style and format. The goal is to provide clear, easy-to-understand HTML concepts and references for beginners.

To make it even more convenient, I have hosted this documentation live using **GitHub Pages**, so you can access it anytime online without cloning the repo.
